  title: Course Introduction / AI in Science Fiction and Philosophy 
  description: In this module I will give an overview of what to expect in the course and how it differs from other related courses at Penn.  We will also discuss the philosophical foundations of artificial intelligence – what great thinkers like Rene Descartes and Alan Turing thought about how artificial intelligence could be defied, and how we could test whether a non-human agent were truly intelligent.  We’ll also review portrayals of AI in Science Fiction, and see discuss what is science fiction and what has become science fact.
