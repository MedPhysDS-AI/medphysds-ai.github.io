Robot Excercise 5: R2D2 Intent Detection [100 points]
=============================================================


## Preface
R2D2â€™s speech recognition system is damaged in a collision. Now R2D2 cannot understand what Luke says and thus cannot assist him during combat. Your task is to implement a new intent detection module to help R2D2 classify different natural language commands.
 
## Instructions

This assignment will focus on a specific area in natural language processing (NLP) called intent detection. An intent detection module that will take in a natural language command, and determine what type of command that a user wants the droid to do. These will include things like driving commands, light commands, changing the position of its head, making sounds, etc.)

For example, the following command belongs to the category 'driving'.
```
"Drive straight ahead for 2 seconds at half speed"
```

A skeleton notebook [r2d2_hw5.ipynb](r2d2_hw5.ipynb) containing empty definitions for each question has been provided. Please do not change any of that. Since portions of this assignment will be graded automatically, none of the names or function signatures in this file should be modified. However, you are free to introduce additional variables or functions if needed. You could use the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to edit the notebook file and conduct the training using the free GPU from Google. 

You are strongly encouraged to follow the Python style guidelines set forth in PEP 8, which was written in part by the creator of Python. However, your code will not be graded for style.

Once you have completed the assignment, you should submit your file on [Gradescope]({{page.submission_link}}).

## Part 0. Natural Language Commands for R2D2 [15 points]

We're going to begin this assignment by brainstorming different commands that we might like to give to our robot.  We'll take several factors into account:
1. What actions can the robot perform?
2. What are different ways that we can describe those actions?

The type of actions that our R2D2s can perform are dictated by its Python API.  You can see a list of the commands in the API like this:

<div class="container-fluid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12" markdown="1">

### Driving API

```python
enter_drive_mode(self)
roll(self, speed, angle, time)
turn(self, angle, **kwargs)
update_position_vector(self, speed, angle, time)
roll_time(self, speed, angle, time, **kwargs)
roll_continuous(self, speed, angle, **kwargs)
restart_continuous_roll(self)
stop_roll(self, **kwargs) 
```
</div>

<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12" markdown="1">

### Driving sentences

state_sentences = [
"What color is your front light?",
"Tell me what color your front light is set to.",
"Is your logic display on?",
"What is your stance?"
"What is your orientation?",
"What direction are you facing?",
"Are you standing on 2 feet or 3?",
"What is your current heading?",
"How much battery do you have left?",
"What is your battery status?",

### Navigation on a grid
The following grid navigation commands are from the [Droid navigation assignment](hw2/homework2.html), not the provided API.  We will support grid navigation commands too.

```python 
Graph(vertics, edges)
A_star(G, start, goal)
path2move(path)
```
</div>


<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12" markdown="1">
### Navigation on a grid

```python 
grid_sentences = [
"You are on a 4 by 5 grid.",
"Each square is 1 foot large.",
"You are at position (0,0).",
"Go to position (3,3).",
"There is an obstacle at position 2,1.",
"There is a chair at position 3,3",
"Go to the left of the chair.",
"Itâ€™s not possible to go from 2,2 to 2,3.", ]
```
</div>

</div>
</div>

For each of the 8 categories of commands please create 10 unique sentences on how you might tell the robot to execute one or more of the actions in that category. You can add add your sentence lists to the code by adding them as arrays called `my_driving_sentences`, `my_light_sentences`, `my_head_sentences`, `my_state_sentences`, `my_connection_sentences`, `my_stance_sentences`, `my_animation_sentences`, and `my_grid_sentences`.

One of the amazing thing about language is that there are many different ways of communicating the same intent.  For example, if we wanted to have our R2D2 start waddling, we could say 
```python 
"waddle",
"totter",
"todder",
"teater",
"wobble",
"start to waddle"
"start waddling",
"begin waddling",
"set your stance to waddle",
"try to stand on your tiptoes",
"move up and down on your toes",
"rock from side to side on your toes",
"imitate a duck's walk",
"walk like a duck"
```
Similarly, if we wanted it to stop, we could prefix the command above with a bunch of ways of saying stop:
```python 
"stop your waddle",
"end your waddle",
"don't waddle anymore",
"stop waddling",
"cease waddling",
"stop standing on your toes",
"stand still"
"stop acting like a duck",
"don't walk like a duck",
"stop teetering like that"
"put your feet flat on the ground"
```

The goal of this part of the assignment is to enumerate as many ways of saying a command as you can think of (minimum of 10 per command group).  We will use these to train an intent detection module.
